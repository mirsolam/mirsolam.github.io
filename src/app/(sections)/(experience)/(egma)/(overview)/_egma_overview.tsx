                                At Egma, I initially started out as a front-end developer working on the company&apos;s web application platform for Optometrists and Ophthalmologists.
                                I quickly started taking ownership of my projects and continuously took initiative in implementing and
                                suggesting solutions for various shorts comings our product, company and the team faced.
                                With this attitude, my work expanded to include back-end development, and to get involved in oboarding new team members.
